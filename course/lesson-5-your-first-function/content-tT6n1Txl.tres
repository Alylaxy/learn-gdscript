Function identifiers cannot contain spaces. In general, names in programming languages cannot contain spaces.

This is because the computer uses spaces to detect the separation between different keywords and identifiers.

Instead of spaces, in GDScript, we use underscores (\"_\"). You saw this already with functions like [code]move_forward()[/code] or [code]move_local_x()[/code].

identifiers also should start with an alphabetical character."
