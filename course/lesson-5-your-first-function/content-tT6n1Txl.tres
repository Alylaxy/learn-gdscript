Your function names cannot contain spaces. In general, names in programming languages cannot contain spaces.

This is because the computer uses spaces to detect the separation between different keywords and names.

Instead of spaces, in GDScript, we write underscores (\"_\").

You saw this already with functions like [code]move_forward()[/code] or [code]move_local_x()[/code]."
