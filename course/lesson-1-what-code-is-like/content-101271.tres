If you want to learn to make games or code but don't know where to start, this course should be perfect.

We designed it for absolute beginners, although if you already know another language, it can also be a fun way to get started with Godot.

We will give you the coding foundations you need to start making games and applications with Godot.

Mind that it will take you time before making your first complete game or app alone."
