If you want to learn to make games or code but don't know where to start, this course should be perfect.

We designed it for absolute beginners, although if you already know another language, it can also be a fun way to get started with Godot.

We will give you the coding foundations you need to start making games and applications with Godot.

Mind that it will take you time before making your first complete game or app alone.

Creating games is more accessible than ever, but it still takes a lot of work and practice.

So try to enjoy the learning process and every little success.

It's important because you will never stop learning as a game designer and developer. You will keep discovering new and more efficient ways to program as you gain experience. 

It's just part of the process.

Also, you shouldn't expect any single course or book to turn you into a professional or teach you everything there is to know. You'll improve a ton through practice.

I've been coding professionally for years, and I still learn new things almost every day."
