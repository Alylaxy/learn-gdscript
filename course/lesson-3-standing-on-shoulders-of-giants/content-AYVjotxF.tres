When coding, you're never quite on your own. Programming languages themselves build upon programs created by previous developers.

Throughout this course, you will use a lot of code created by the Godot developers.

The first code you'll write will [i]call functions[/i] created by other programmers.

A function is a list of instructions for the computer with an exact name. By using that name, we tell the computer to execute all the instructions in sequence.

[font=res://ui/theme/fonts/font_lesson_heading.tres]Calling functions[/font]

When you tell the computer to execute a function, we say you [i]call[/i] the function.

To [i]call[/i] a function, you write its exact name followed by an opening and a closing parenthesis. To call the function named \"show\", you would write [code]show()[/code].

The code listing below contains two lines of code calling the [code]show()[/code] and [code]hide()[/code] functions."
