When coding, you're never quite on your own. Programming languages themselves build upon programs created by previous developers.

Throughout this course, you will use a lot of code created by the Godot developers.

The first code you'll write will [i]call functions[/i] created by other programmers.

A function is a list of instructions for the computer with an exact name. By using that name, we tell the computer to execute all the instructions in sequence.

When you tell the computer to execute a function, we say you [i]call[/i] the function.

To [i]call[/i] a function, you write its exact name followed by an opening and a closing parenthesis. To call the function named \"show\", you would write [code]show()[/code].

The code listing below contains two lines of code calling the [code]show()[/code] and [code]hide()[/code] functions.In Godot, calling [code]show()[/code] makes something visible, like a character or item. The complementary [code]hide()[/code] function hides the entity.

Once an entity is visible, calling [code]show()[/code] again doesn't have any effect.

Similarly, once you hid something, calling [code]hide()[/code] again doesn't change anything.
