When coding, you're never quite on your own. Programming languages themselves are based on programs created by fellow developers.

Throughout this course, you will use a lot of code created by the Godot developers.

The first code you'll write will [i]call functions[/i] created by other programmers.

A function is a list of instructions for the computer with an exact name. By calling that name, we tell the computer to execute all the instructions sequentially.

To call a function, you write its exact name followed by an opening and a closing parenthesis.

The code listing below contains two lines of code calling the [code]show()[/code] and [code]hide()[/code] functions respectively."
