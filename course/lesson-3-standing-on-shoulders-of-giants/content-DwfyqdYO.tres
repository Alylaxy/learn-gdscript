We use parentheses to call functions. The reason is you can give the function [i]parameters[/i] inside the parentheses. 

Parameters are values (numbers, bits of text, and more) that change how the function behaves. We also call them [i]arguments[/i] (you'll see moving forward there are many synonyms in computer programming). 

Parameters let you fine-tune the effect of the function call.

Here's a [i]sprite[/i] standing straight. If we call the [code]rotate()[/code] function with a decimal number as its only parameter, the character [i]sprite[/i] turns.

Notice how we use a dot in the number [code]0.3[/code] below: you need to use a dot like this to represent decimal numbers. You can't use commas as they have a different purpose in code."
