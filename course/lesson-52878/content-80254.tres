text = "Along the way, we'll teach you:

- Some of the mindset you need as a developer. Too many programming courses skip that, but it's essential.
- Some foundations of game programming. Knowing that will help you with any game engine.
- How to write real code with the GDScript language.
- Most of the GDScript language's syntax.

As you go through the course, you will have many questions. We will answer them as we go.

But at first, there is so much to cover that we'll have to take a few shortcuts.

We don't want to [i]overwhelm[/i] you with information. We also want to respect the pace at which our brains memorize things.

We broke down the course into bite-size lessons with many short practices to get to use, repeat, and remember everything.

If we shoved too much in each part, you'd learn slower.

If at any time you're left with burning questions, you're more than welcome to join [url=https://discord.gg/87NNb3Z]our Discord community[/url]."
