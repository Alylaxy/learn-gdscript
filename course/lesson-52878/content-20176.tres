text = "GDScript Learn is a Free and Open-Source app and series to help you learn to code, [b]from zero[/b], with Godot's GDScript programming language.

Whether you want to learn game development or just code with exciting interactive projects, this app is for you.

There are no hidden fees: 1600 backers who pre-ordered our course on Kickstarter funded this app.

As a result, we could make everything in here free for everyone.

We're making a complete course to get up to speed with the GDScript programming language.

It complements the free course you will find in the Godot documentation (we contributed to it too).

Disclaimer: The app is in a beta state. You may encounter bugs, typos, and more.

Please use the button in the top menu to report the issue when this happens.

It is crucial: we'll use your reports to fix issues for you and everyone else."
