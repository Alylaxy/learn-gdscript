# Introduction to member variables

In this lesson, we take a first look at member variables.

In games, you need to keep track of the player score, a character's health, their last known position in the level when they save the game, and so much more.

In other words, you need to store, retrieve, and update information.

The tool to do that when your game is running is called variables.

Variables are labels you use to keep track of values that vary over time. For example, a character may have 5 health points. When taking a hit, the health should go down to 4.

To keep track of that, you can create a variable named health to which you add and subtract points.
