In games, you need to keep track of many values that change over time:

- The player score.
- Every character or enemy's health.
- The last checkpoint.

And so much more. You need to store, retrieve, and update those values.

Variables are labels you use to keep track of values that vary over time. Here's an example of a variable tracking a character or monster's health."
