It's a bit limiting, you'll admit.

Instead, it would be much better if we had a function to draw any square. Or better: any kind of rectangle (a square is a specific kind of rectangle).

We can do that by giving our function [i]parameters[/i]. Parameters are labels you give to values passed to the function.

You used a function parameter when calling the rotate() function in a previous lesson."
