There will always be milliseconds variations from frame to frame.

That is why the [code]_process()[/code] function receives a [code]delta[/code] parameter.

The word \"delta\" represents a time difference. It's the time passed since the previous frame, in seconds.

The [code]delta[/code] parameter tells us how fast Godot took to complete the [b]previous frame[/b].

We can use it to ensure that the variations between frames doesn't make the game's simulation unreliable."
