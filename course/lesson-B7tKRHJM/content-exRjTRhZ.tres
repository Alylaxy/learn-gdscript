An angle of [code]PI[/code] radians corresponds to [code]180[/code] degrees. And [code]2 * PI[/code] is a full turn: [code]360[/code] degrees.

Even if you're not familiar with the term radian, you've most likely seen them before.

You find that [code]2 [i] PI[/code] in the calculation of a circle's perimeter, which you probably learned at school ([code]perimeter = 2 [/i] PI * r[/code]). Two times the number PI represents a full turn around the circle in radians.[/i]"
