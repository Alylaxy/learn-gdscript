# GDScript Live Editor

This is a Godot project demonstrating loading a scene and enabling live editing and reloading of the scene's scripts

At the moment, the project only runs in the editor, as the script's source is only available there.

Conversely, parsing errors are only recoverable from in an export, as the editor will break.
