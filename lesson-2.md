# Lesson 2: your first error

When you program, you are bound to run into errors. Tons of them.

But you shouldn't worry! On the computer, **errors are a good thing**.

You will encounter errors, and that's okay: every programmer does. Especially professionals.

At school, maybe you learned that making mistakes is not a good thing.

When you code something, it's not the case: errors help you write correct programs.

It's just the computer telling you it doesn't understand something or some code you wrote has a specific issue you can fix.

An error looks like this. It's a message that tells you some bit of your code doesn't work.

## Making errors friendlier

Error messages can look a bit cryptic. It's because they're designed by programmers, for trained programmers.

We added an error translator in this app that will help you get started.

It shows you why an error happens and what the message means. It also gives you some tips on how to fix it.

Errors are messages designed on purpose by fellow programmers who came before you. They anticipated you might get into specific issues.

You shouldn't think of an error as a failure: it is a mentor helping you from the past.

Importantly, errors won't break your computer. At least not with GDScript: it's a pretty safe language.
